# Beijing-Air-Quality

This study uses RStudio and SQL to explore how different machine learning techniques can predict air quality in Beijing.

Training data is taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and consists of hourly readings of various atmospheric and weather conditions in Beijing over a four year period. PM2.5 is considered as the most important measure of air pollution and therefore is treated as the dependent variable which the models will aim to forecast. 

Linear regression, time series and regression tree are used to predict PM2.5 whilst the performance of the models are evaluated ny comparing correlation tests, RMSE and MAE.
